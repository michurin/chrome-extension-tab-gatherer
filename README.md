# Tab-gatherer

Extension groups tabs for you automatically.
Groups are based on domains and trying to take into account your current groups of tabs.

### TODO

- [must have] Icons in manifest
- `homepage_url` in manifest
- [must have] Publish (while you can try it in deveoper mode)
- Extending logic of grouping (?)
- Saving state (?) saving preferences (domains? groups names? colors?)
