# Tab gatherer

Extension groups tabs for you automatically.
Groups are based on domains and trying to take into account your current groups of tabs.

### TODO

- ~~[must have] Icons in manifest~~
- ~~`homepage_url` in manifest~~
- Options page. Microroadmap:
  - thinks don't required extra permissions:
    - turn on/off instant grouping: create new group even for single new tab
    - turn on/off grouping `chrome://` tabs
    - turn on/off grouping `file://` tabs
    - turn on/off minimum group size: remove groups smaller then N tabs automatically
- [must have] Publish (while you can try it in deveoper mode)
- [nice to have] Setup eslint
- [nice to have] Setup CI
- Saving state (?) saving preferences (domains? groups names? colors?)
