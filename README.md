# Tab gatherer

Extension groups tabs for you automatically.
Groups are based on domains and trying to take into account your current groups of tabs.

### TODO

  - thinks don't required extra permissions:
    - turn on/off instant grouping: create new group even for single new tab
    - turn on/off grouping `chrome://` tabs
- [must have] Publish (while you can try it in deveoper mode)
